    new define in private.h
    //#define NOT_ALL_IFACES 
    for compatibility with original libartnet
    
    in libartnet-win32 the function get_ifaces()
    gets all interfaces 
    (including not connected interfaces and loopback)
    by default
    You can deactivate this behaviour by uncommenting
    the define
    #define NOT_ALL_IFACES
    
    BUT: i was able to receive from local applications
    on linux when listing all interfaces !
    For more details see the documentation

		* port to WIN32
		* enable multiple nodes on same ip address
		* enable binding to special ip address
		* set another broadcast mask
		
		=== MOST IMPORTANT ===
		=== Multiple nodes on same ip address:
		Although artnet gives you the opportunity to transfer
		DMX data via ethernet, it should be possible to have
		several artnet nodes on the same computer
		(for example DMX-Software / artnet-sender, artnet-receiver,
		 artnet-monitor ...)
		
		This can be done by using the option SO_REUSEADDR for the sockets.
		Call 
		o artnet_new_mod() with artnet_start_params -> reuse = 1
		instead of
		o artnet_new()
		to make it possible to run several nodes on the same pc
		
		IMPORTANT: Many dmx programs do not use that option so
		first start your dmx software and then start artnet-software
		made with this library. The other order might not work
		  
		Examples in the subdirectory:
		As i am no specialist in makefiles there is no makefile for
		win32. Just use compile.bat and change the directories 
		according to your needs.
